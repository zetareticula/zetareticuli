## Features

- Full integration of the e-commerce platform engine within the storage infrastructure
- Elimination of intermediate layers between the platform and storage
- Faster and more efficient e-commerce operations in cloud-based environments
- Improved performance, scalability, and efficiency in online retail environments.
